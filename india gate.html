        <h2><b>About</b></h2>
        <p>
        The India Gate (originally the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath, on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi,[1] formal called Kingsway .It stands as a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.[2] Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the triumphal arch such as the Arch of Constantine, in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.

Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1972, a structure consisting of a black marble plinth with a reversed rifle, capped by a war helmet and bounded by four eternal flames, was built beneath the archway. This structure, called Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served as India's tomb of the unknown soldier. India Gate is counted amongst the largest war memorials in India and every Republic Day, the Prime Minister visits the gate to pay their tributes to the Amar Jawan Jyoti, following which the Republic Day parade starts. The memorial-gate is also a popular spot for protests by the civil society in New Delhi.</p>
        <h2><b>Timings</b></h2>
        <p>The timings of India Gate in Delhi are quite flexible. Since this iconic monument is situated on an open square, there are no timing restrictions as such. The monument is open all day on all days of the week. However, the best time to visit India Gate is between 07:00 PM and 09:30 PM.

        <h2>Interesting Facts on Jama Masjid </h2>
        <p><strong>#1 At that Time, Jama Masjid Cost Around One Million Rupees </strong></p>
        <p>Yes, you heard it right. Jama Masjid’s approximate costing was calculated to be around one million rupees at that time. The whole design and infrastructure were done during Shah Jahan’s rule, under the supervision of Saadullah Khan who was the Wazir during Jahan’s reign.</p>
        <p><strong>#2 More than 5000 Workers were Involved </strong></p>
        <p>Clearing people’s doubt, Jama Masjid was constructed with the help of more than 5000 workers at that time. An enormous force was hired by Shah Jahan that ensured the creation of this mosque or monument, whatever you want to call it. Imam Bukhari, a Muslim priest from Bukhara inaugurated the mosque on the invitation from Shah Jahan.</p>
        <p><strong>#3 British Wanted to Destroy Jama Masjid </strong></p>
        <p>After winning the revolt of 1857, the British seized the mosque by settling and stationing their soldiers here. According to sources, the British carried a deep desire to destroy this mosque for punishing the people of the city. But due to strong opposition by the local people, British were unable to do it and hence Jama Masjid survived and became one of the most historic monuments available in India.</p>
